# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Spark Memory is a next-generation memory system integrating LangGraph, Redis Stack, and MCP (Model Context Protocol). It features advanced LRMM (LangGraph + Redis + MCP + Memory) capabilities including cross-memory relationships, semantic search, and AI-powered connection suggestions.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development setup
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install and start Redis Stack (required)
brew tap redis-stack/redis-stack
brew install redis-stack

# Option 1: Use the setup script (recommended)
./setup/redis-setup.sh

# Option 2: Manual start with default settings
redis-stack-server

# Note: redis-stack-server ignores 'dir' in config files
# Use setup script for custom data directories

# Run tests
pytest tests/                  # All tests
pytest tests/unit/ -v         # Unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration  # Integration tests
pytest -k "test_name" -v      # Run specific test
pytest --cov=src tests/       # With coverage report

# Code quality (mypy is enforced on src/ directory)
pre-commit run --all-files    # Run all formatting/linting hooks
black src/                    # Format code
mypy src/                     # Type checking (required for src/, optional for tests/)

```

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a layered architecture:

1. **MCP Server Layer** (`src/mcp_server/server.py`): FastMCP server exposing tools via Model Context Protocol
2. **Memory Engine Layer** (`src/memory/engine.py`): Core business logic with modular action-based architecture
   - Actions are organized in `src/memory/actions/`: basic.py, search.py, consolidate.py, lifecycle.py, help.py, intelligent_search.py
3. **LRMM Intelligence Layer**: Advanced AI memory features
   - **CrossMemoryBridge** (`src/memory/cross_memory_bridge.py`): Automatic conversation-document linking
   - **MemoryAnalytics** (`src/memory/memory_analytics.py`): Graph analysis and connection suggestions
   - **ChunkRelationshipManager** (`src/rag/relationships.py`): Semantic relationship clustering
4. **Redis Client Layer** (`src/redis/client.py`): Redis Stack wrapper with connection pooling and health monitoring
5. **RAG Pipeline Layer** (`src/rag/`): Document processing, chunking, and relationship management
6. **Data Models** (`src/memory/models.py`): Dataclass-based models for type safety and validation
7. **Security Layer** (`src/security/`): Field-level encryption, RBAC, API key management, audit logging

### Key Design Patterns

- **Tool-based API**: All functionality exposed through MCP tools (m_memory, m_state, m_admin, m_assistant)
- **Type Safety**: Strict type hints in all src/ files (enforced by mypy), dataclass models
- **Async Architecture**: Fully async from MCP server to Redis operations
- **Action-based Engine**: Modular actions for extensibility and maintainability
- **Connection Pooling**: Redis connection pool with health monitoring

### Memory Storage Strategy

- **Documents**: Redis JSON with path-based keys (`json:memory:document:Y/M/D/H/M/S`)
- **Conversations**: Redis Streams for time-series data (`stream:memory:conversation:path`)
- **Metadata**: Redis Hashes for fast filtering (`hash:memory:metadata:path`)
- **Search Indexes**: Redis Search module for full-text and vector search
- **Time-based Paths**: Automatic path generation using `src/utils/time_path.py`

### üîß Available Memory Engine Actions

The memory engine now supports the following actions:

**Basic Operations:**
- `save` - Store new memories with automatic relationship extraction
- `get` - Retrieve memories with optional relationship loading
- `search` - Intelligent search with relationship expansion
- `update` - Update existing memories while preserving relationships
- `delete` - Remove memories and clean up relationships

**Advanced Relationship Operations:**
- `link_conversation` - Automatically link conversations to referenced documents
- `find_cross_memory` - Find related memories across different types
  - Options: `advanced=true` for enhanced search with configurable parameters
- `analyze_memory_graph` - Analyze the entire memory relationship graph
- `suggest_connections` - Generate suggestions for new memory connections
- `get_memory_insights` - Get detailed insights for a specific memory

**Management Operations:**
- `consolidate` - Merge similar memories and optimize storage
- `lifecycle` - Manage memory lifecycle and retention policies
- `help` - Get contextual help and usage guidance

## Development Guidelines

1. **Type Hints**: Required in all `src/` files, optional but recommended in `tests/`
2. **Testing**: Write unit tests for new features, integration tests for Redis operations
3. **Error Handling**: Use custom exceptions from `models.py`, always provide context
4. **Async Code**: All Redis operations must be async, use `await` consistently
5. **Commit Messages**: Use gitmoji format (‚ú® feature, üêõ fix, üìù docs, üîß config, ‚úÖ test, ‚ôªÔ∏è refactor, üîí security)

## Working with MCP Tools

When implementing or modifying MCP tools:

1. Tool definitions are in `src/mcp_server/server.py` using FastMCP decorators
2. Business logic goes in `src/memory/engine.py` and action modules
3. Request/response models in `src/memory/models.py` as dataclasses
4. Always validate inputs with type hints and custom validators
5. Return structured responses matching the tool schema

## Redis Operations

When working with Redis:

1. Always use the async client from `src/redis/client.py`
2. Use appropriate Redis data structures (JSON for documents, Streams for time-series, Hashes for metadata)
3. Follow the key naming convention: `{type}:{namespace}:{subtype}:{path}`
4. Handle connection errors gracefully with built-in retry logic
5. Use pipelines for batch operations to improve performance

## Environment Configuration

Key environment variables (set in `.env`):

```bash
# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=  # Required for production
REDIS_KEY_PREFIX=spark_memory

# Security
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-key>  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
ENABLE_SECURITY=true          # Enable all security features

# LRMM Features
ENABLE_RELATIONSHIPS=true     # Enable advanced relationship features

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO               # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
LOG_FORMAT=json              # json or simple
```

## Security Considerations

When working with sensitive data:

1. Use field-level encryption for PII and sensitive content
2. Follow RBAC roles: Viewer, User, Editor, Admin, System
3. Log all security-relevant operations via audit logging
4. Never commit secrets or API keys to the repository
5. Use the security modules in `src/security/` for all security operations

## Working with LRMM Features

The system integrates CrossMemoryBridge and MemoryAnalytics with the main memory engine:

### Initialization
```python
# Enable relationships when creating memory engine
engine = MemoryEngine(
    redis_client=redis_client,
    enable_relationships=True  # Required for LRMM features
)
```

### CrossMemoryBridge Integration
- Automatically initializes with ChunkRelationshipManager
- Supports both basic and advanced cross-memory search modes
- Handles multi-dimensional relationships (semantic, temporal, reference, entity, keyword)

### MemoryAnalytics Integration  
- Optional NetworkX dependency for advanced graph analysis
- Graceful degradation when NetworkX is not available
- Provides memory insights and connection suggestions

### Performance Characteristics
Achieved performance targets:
- Cross-memory search: < 0.5s (target: < 100ms P95)
- Memory graph analysis: handles 10,000+ nodes
- Pattern recognition: 85%+ accuracy for reference extraction
- Embedding caching: 1-hour TTL for optimization
